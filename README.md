# 🧠 Arcodius OS – An AI-Native Operating System

---

## 🔷 Project Title:

**Arcodius OS – A Systems AI-Powered Operating System**

## 🔷 Vision Statement:

*Arcodius OS* is a next-generation operating system built from the ground up with **AI as a core component** — not as an application or tool, but as an **embedded, intelligent system entity**. The OS will dynamically adapt, optimize resources, automate user workflows, and learn over time, creating a seamless, proactive, and highly efficient user experience.
